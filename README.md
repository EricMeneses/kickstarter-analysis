# An Analysis of Kickstarer Campaigns - Outcomes Based on Goals vs Launch Date
## As requested by Louise, I have compiled data to show how other kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
### The purpose of this analysis is to compare Louise's experience with others to see what she may have done differently to have met her actual goal as opposed to being close to reaching her goal.
## Analysis and Challenges

### ![Theater Outcomes Based on Goals](https://github.com/EricMeneses/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png?raw=true)
### A foreseeable challenge could be that the higher the monetary goal for Kickstarter Campaigns, there were lower samples to test for this study. For example, Outcomes Based on Goals shows that Kickstarter Campaigns with a Goal between $35,000-$39,999 have a higher success rate, but this is only sampling 6 camapagins whereas Goals set between $1,000-$4,999 sampled 534 Kickstarter Campaigns. The larger the sample, the higher the probability.
## Results
- When addressing Outcomes Based on Launch Date, we can easily assess that Theater Kickstarters starting in May have a much higher success rate than any other time of the year.  We can also tell that there are far more Kickstarter Campaigns in the summer months than any other time of the year.
- According to the Outcomes Based on Goals, we can confirm that Kickstarter Campaigns for Theatrical Plays are more likely to reach their goal if the monetary amount is less than $4,999, it is roughly a 50/50 gamble for goals between $10,000-$24,999, anything after this amount drops in success.
- This data set only accounts for Kickstarter Campaigns up to 2017. Seeing as we are in the year 2020, we are missing 2 years of data that could potentially impact Louise's decision.
- Additional tables that may serve a purpose for this analysis would be to see how many people backed the Kickstarter Campaign to see if there were any correlation between monetary goal and amount of people that helped back the campaign to see if this had anything to do with the campaign being successful or not.
